	abstract = {The Poiseuille and Darcy laws describe the velocity of groundwater ﬂow under laminar conditions. These laws were deducted empirically in conduit and porous systems, respectively, and are widely used to model the groundwater ﬂow. The analytical relationship between these hydraulic laws has been found by draining a tank-reservoir. Based on equations found, the discharge in a conduit under the Poiseuille law can be transformed in the same amount ﬂowing inside a darcian system, and vice versa. This transformation occurs, for example, in karst aquifers, from the matrix to karst conduits during discharge phases, and from conduits to matrix during recharge phases.},

Sources of hydrogen near the ground, other than soil moisture, affect the neutron measurement and therefore must be quantiﬁed. This study investigates the effect of atmospheric water vapor on the cosmic-ray probe signal and evaluates the fast neutron response in realistic atmospheric conditions using the neutron transport code Monte Carlo N-Particle {eXtended} ({MCNPX}). The vertical height of inﬂuence of the sensor in the atmosphere varies between 412 and 265 m in dry and wet atmospheres, respectively. Model results show that atmospheric water vapor near the surface affects the neutron intensity signal by up to 12\%, corresponding to soil moisture differences on the order of 0.10 m3 m23. A simple correction is deﬁned to identify the true signal associated with integrated soil moisture that rescales the measured neutron intensity to that which would have been observed in the atmospheric conditions prevailing on the day of sensor calibration. Use of this approach is investigated with in situ observations at two sites characterized by strong seasonality in water vapor where standard meteorological measurements are readily available.},

However, the application of this method is hampered by its susceptibility to the presence of aboveground biomass. Here we present a simple empirical framework to account for moderation of fast neutrons by aboveground biomass in the calibration. The method extends the N0-calibration function and was developed using an extensive data set from a network of 10 cosmic ray probes located in the Rur catchment, Germany. The results suggest a 0.9\% reduction in fast neutron intensity per 1 kg of dry aboveground biomass per m2 or per 2 kg of biomass water equivalent per m2. We successfully tested the novel vegetation correction using temporary cosmic ray probe measurements along a strong gradient in biomass due to deforestation, and using the {COSMIC}, and the hmf method as independent soil water content retrieval algorithms. The extended N0-calibration function was able to explain 95\% of the overall variability in fast neutron intensity.},

	abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron sensors ({CRNS}) enable noninvasive determination of field-scale soil moisture content by exploiting the dependence of the intensity of aboveground epithermal neutrons on the hydrogen contained in soil moisture. However, there are other hydrogen pools besides soil moisture (e.g., biomass). Therefore, these hydrogen pools should be considered for accurate soil moisture content measurements, especially when they are changing dynamically (e.g., arable crops, deforestation, and reforestation). In this study, we test four approaches for the correction of biomass effects on soil moisture content measurements with {CRNS} using experiments with three crops (sugar beet, winter wheat, and maize) based on high-quality reference soil moisture: (a) site-specific functions based on in-situ measured biomass, (b) a generic approach, (c) the thermal-to-epithermal neutron ratio (Nr), and (d) the thermal neutron intensity. Bare soil calibration of the {CRNS} resulted in high root mean square errors ({RMSEs}) of 0.097, 0.041, and 0.019 m³/ m³ between estimated and reference soil moisture content for sugar beet, winter wheat, and maize, respectively. Considering in-situ measured biomass for correction reduced the {RMSE} to 0.015, 0.018, and 0.009 m³/m³. The consideration of thermal neutron intensity for correction was similarly accurate. We also explored the use of {CRNS} for biomass estimation and found that Nr only provided accurate biomass estimates for sugar beet. In contrast, we found significant site-specific relationships between biomass and thermal neutron intensity for all three crops, suggesting that thermal neutron intensity can be used both to improve {CRNS}-based soil moisture content measurements and to quantify crop biomass.},

	abstract = {During the past decade, cosmic-ray neutron sensing technology has enabled researchers to reveal soil moisture spatial patterns and to estimate landscape-average soil moisture for hydrological and agricultural applications. However, reliance on rare materials such as helium-3 increases the cost of cosmic-ray neutron probes ({CRNPs}) and limits the adoption of this unique technology beyond the realm of academic research. In this study, we evaluated a novel lower cost {CRNP} based on moderated ultra-thin lithium-6 foil (Li foil system) technology against a commercially-available {CRNP} based on {BF}
              3
              (boron trifluoride, {BF}-3 system). The study was conducted in a cropped field located in the Konza Prairie Biological Station near Manhattan, Kansas, {USA} (325 m a.s.l.) from 10 April 2020 to 18 June 2020. During this period the mean atmospheric pressure was 977 {kPa}, the mean air relative humidity was 70\%, and the average volumetric soil water content was 0.277 m

              m
              −3
              . Raw fast neutron counts were corrected for atmospheric pressure, atmospheric water vapor, and incoming neutron flux. Calibration of the {CRNPs} was conducted using four intensive field surveys (
              n
              \&gt; 120), in combination with continuous observations from an existing array of

              2
              = 0.91) to that of the {BF}-3 system. The Li foil system had an average of 2,250 corrected neutron counts per hour with an uncertainty of 2.25\%, values that are specific to the instrument size, detector configuration, and atmospheric conditions.

	abstract = {Abstract. Soil moisture status in land surface models ({LSMs}) can be updated by assimilating cosmic-ray neutron intensity measured in air above the surface. This requires a fast and accurate model to calculate the neutron intensity from the profiles of soil moisture modeled by the {LSM}. The existing Monte Carlo N-Particle {eXtended} ({MCNPX}) model is sufficiently accurate but too slow to be practical in the context of data assimilation. Consequently an alternative and efficient model is needed which can be calibrated accurately to reproduce the calculations made by {MCNPX} and used to substitute for {MCNPX} during data assimilation. This paper describes the construction and calibration of such a model, {COsmic}-ray Soil Moisture Interaction Code ({COSMIC}), which is simple, physically based and analytic, and which, because it runs at least 50 000 times faster than {MCNPX}, is appropriate in data assimilation applications. The model includes simple descriptions of (a) degradation of the incoming high-energy neutron flux with soil depth, (b) creation of fast neutrons at each depth in the soil, and (c) scattering of the resulting fast neutrons before they reach the soil surface, all of which processes may have parameterized dependency on the chemistry and moisture content of the soil. The site-to-site variability in the parameters used in {COSMIC} is explored for 42 sample sites in the {COsmic}-ray Soil Moisture Observing System ({COSMOS}), and the comparative performance of {COSMIC} relative to {MCNPX} when applied to represent interactions between cosmic-ray neutrons and moist soil is explored. At an example site in Arizona, fast-neutron counts calculated by {COSMIC} from the average soil moisture profile given by an independent network of point measurements in the {COSMOS} probe footprint are similar to the fast-neutron intensity measured by the {COSMOS} probe. It was demonstrated that, when used within a data assimilation framework to assimilate {COSMOS} probe counts into the Noah land surface model at the Santa Rita Experimental Range field site, the calibrated {COSMIC} model provided an effective mechanism for translating model-calculated soil moisture profiles into aboveground fast-neutron count when applied with two radically different approaches used to remove the bias between data and model.},

The {COSMOS} has already deployed more than 50 of the eventual 500 cosmic-ray probes, distributed mainly in the {USA}, each generating a time series of average soil moisture over its horizontal footprint, with similar networks coming into existence around the world. This paper is written to serve a community need to better understand this novel method and the {COSMOS} project.

This difﬁculty has resulted in limited applications of {SAR} as an operational source of soil moisture in hydrology despite the demonstrated beneﬁts of high-resolution distributed soil moisture. Technical and methodological advances such as multi-conﬁguration radar and forthcoming {SAR} constellations are increasingly mitigating the shortcomings of {SAR} with respect to soil moisture estimation at the ﬁeld and catchment scale. At the same time, progress in data assimilation and a better understanding of the impact of phenomena, such as climate change, are revealing the hydrological importance of soil moisture spatial distribution. Thus, despite the currently modest retrieval accuracy, {SAR} is an important source of soil moisture state information for the hydrological community. Towards the end of increasing the hydrological utilization of {SAR} soil moisture, a comprehensive literature review was conducted to provide the state-of-the-art of {SAR} soil moisture retrieval methodology, its limitations and potential. Following the methodology review, a discussion of the beneﬁts and limitations of soil moisture data retrieved from {SAR} is used to outline the scope of {SAR} derived soil moisture for hydrological applications.},

At one of the sites horizontal lines and additional vertical transmission lines with electrical impedance discontinuities were installed for compar­ ison. Measurements of water content using a portable {TDR} cable tester were made periodically during the growing season. Compar­ isons of water contents by {TDR} with those from gravimetric samples showed that generally both were the same values. Standard devia­ tions of differences between {TDR} and gravimetric values were ± 0.02 m’m”’ when measured locations were the same but increased to ± 0.06 m’m“’ when measured locations were different. Repeated measurements at the same location were highly correlated, one with another, over the season. Analysis of variance showed that all trans­ mission line types were yielding equivalent values and that the hor­ izontal transmission lines gave the minimum standard error of the mean. Data from transmission lines with impedance discontinuities gave water content profiles from a single measurement but the anal­ yses of the {TDR} data curves were more complex than for the lines wihtout impedance discontinuities.
