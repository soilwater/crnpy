<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soilwater/crnpy/main/docs/img/logo/crnpy-logo.png" alt="CRNPY logo" width="250"/>

## Overview

Welcome to the homepage of the CRNPy (Cosmic-Ray Neutron Python) library, an open-source Python library designed for the processing and conversion of raw neutron counts from cosmic-ray neutron probes (CRNP) into field-level soil moisture data.

This library has been developed with the intent of providing a comprehensive yet easy-to-use workflow for processing raw data from a variety of CRNP, encompassing multiple manufacturers and models.

## Key Features
- Versatile and instrument agnostic: CRNPy can handle data from various CRNP manufacturers and models. It has been successfully tested on both roving and stationary CRNP.

- Modular: The library is designed to be modular, allowing users to easily customize the processing workflow to their needs.


## Installation

To install the CRNPy library, you can use Python's package manager. Open a terminal and type:

```pip install crnpy```

from the Jupyter notebook, type:

```!pip install crnpy```

## Authors

The CRNPy library was developed at the Kansas State University Soil Water Processes Lab by:

- Joaquin Peraza

- Andres Patrignani


The Soil Water Processes Lab at Kansas State University combines a range of experimental and computational approaches to tackle pressing issues in soil and water research. The development of the CRNPy library is a step forward to creating reproducible data processing workflows across the scientific community using cosmic-ray neutrons probes for soil moisture sensing.
